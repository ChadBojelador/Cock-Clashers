# 🐓 TikTiLaFight: Object-Oriented Coliseum

## 📘 Project Overview
**TikTiLaFight: Object-Oriented Coliseum** is a Java-based battle simulator game inspired by Pokémon-style combat mechanics, but instead of Pokémon, it features **roosters** as the main battling entities.  

The project aims to apply the fundamental principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — including **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction** — in designing an interactive and modular Java application.  

## 🎯 Description (Unfinished Draft)
In **TikTiLaFight**, players can select their **roosters**, each with distinct attributes such as **HP**, **Attack**, **Defense**, and unique **skills**. Battles occur in a **turn-based system**, where strategy and timing determine the winner.  

The game currently includes:
- A base `Rooster` class with key attributes and methods.
- A structure for subclasses representing different **rooster types**.
- A **battle logic system** that calculates attacks and damage.
- Planned integration of a **JavaFX-based GUI** for a more engaging experience.

The main goal of the game is to... *(unfinished)*  

Future improvements and planned features:
- Rooster **types** with varying strengths and weaknesses.  
- Implementation of **special skill classes** and animations.  
- Enhanced **AI opponent** and difficulty levels.  
- Player **progression system** and data saving.

## 🧠 Concepts Applied
- **Encapsulation** – protecting class data through private fields and getters/setters.  
- **Inheritance** – allowing various rooster types to inherit properties from the base class.  
- **Polymorphism** – enabling different attack behaviors depending on the rooster type.  
- **Abstraction** – simplifying complex battle mechanics into reusable class structures.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Framework:** JavaFX (for GUI implementation)  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub  

## 📁 Planned Project Structure

## 👥 Collaborators
| Name | Role | Contribution |
|------|------|---------------|
