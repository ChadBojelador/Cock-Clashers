📄 GameConstants Class Documentation

Overview

The GameConstants class serves as a centralized container for all fixed, unchanging values used throughout Cock Clashers: Object-Oriented Coliseum.
These constants include rooster base stats, damage modifiers, type information, file paths for images and audio, and combat-related values such as critical hit mechanics.

By organizing constants in one location, the project promotes maintainability, readability, and consistency across multiple modules.


---

Purpose

The primary purpose of GameConstants is to:

Store essential, unchanging game values in a single source of truth

Prevent hard-coding values directly inside classes

Facilitate easier balancing and updating of game mechanics

Provide clean access to assets such as images, UI backgrounds, and sound effects


This design reduces redundancy and potential errors when modifying game attributes.


---

System Role

The class acts as a global configuration and asset reference.
It is frequently used by:

RoosterFactory → to generate roosters with correct stats

Battle mechanics → to apply minimum damage and critical modifiers

JavaFX GUI system → to load visual and audio resources


Because all fields are public static final, the class behaves like a utility constants repository.

Categories of Constants

🔹 1. Combat and Damage Values

Constant	Description

MIN_DAMAGE	Minimum possible damage dealt to ensure attacks are always meaningful
CRIT_CHANCE	Probability of landing a critical hit (15%)
CRIT_MULTIPLIER	Damage multiplier applied during critical hits (x2.0)


These constants influence battle calculations and balancing.

🔹 2. Rooster Base Stats

These constants define the fundamental attributes of each playable rooster type:

Manok na Pula (Fire Type)

HP: MANOK_PULA_HP = 120

ATK: MANOK_PULA_ATK = 30

DEF: MANOK_PULA_DEF = 10

Type: MANOK_PULA_TYPE = "fire"


Manok na Itim (Dark Type)

HP: MANOK_ITIM_HP = 100

ATK: MANOK_ITIM_ATK = 40

DEF: MANOK_ITIM_DEF = 8

Type: MANOK_ITIM_TYPE = "dark"


Manok na Bato (Rock Type)

HP: MANOK_BATO_HP = 150

ATK: MANOK_BATO_ATK = 20

DEF: MANOK_BATO_DEF = 20

Type: MANOK_BATO_TYPE = "rock"


These values are used primarily by RoosterFactory to instantiate rooster objects.


---

🔹 3. Asset File Paths (Graphics & Sprites)

Used by the GUI system for rendering backgrounds and character sprites.

Battle UI Backgrounds

City background

Arena base platform


Rooster Sprites (Front & Back Views)

Each rooster has two images:

Player-side (back)

Enemy-side (front)


These file paths ensure correct loading of character visuals.


---

🔹 4. Music and Sound Effects

Constants for background music (BGM) and sound effects (SFX):

Music Tracks

Title theme

Adventure theme

Battle theme


Sound Effects

Menu movement, confirm, cancel

Skill, magic, hit, impact

Healing sound

Victory and defeat jingles

Rooster cry and wing flap


These constants simplify audio management across the application.


---

Design Principles Applied

✔ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

This class holds constants only; it does not contain logic or methods.

✔ Maintainability & Scalability

Developers can update stats, paths, or balance values in one place.

✔ Readability

Clear naming conventions help avoid confusion or misconfiguration.

✔ Avoiding Magic Numbers

All numeric values are represented symbolically for clarity.


---

Benefits

Centralized control over stats and resource paths

Easy balancing and tweaking without modifying multiple classes

Reduces chances of inconsistencies or typos

Clean, structured organization of asset references



---

Future Enhancements

Separate constants into multiple classes (AudioConstants, RoosterStats, UIPaths) for improved modularity

Add elemental type strengths/weaknesses for advanced combat mechanics

Create JSON or XML configuration to allow dynamic editing without recompiling

Support multiple skins and additional rooster variants
