Open a Clip and set volume using FloatControl.

Start playback with optional looping.



2. Playing Sound Effects:

Run in a separate thread to avoid blocking game logic.

Load the audio file and open a Clip.

Adjust volume and play once.

Automatically close the clip when finished.



3. Volume and Mute Handling:

Volume can be set dynamically using setVolume().

toggleMute() sets volume to minimum or restores previous volume.
