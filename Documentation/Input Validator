📄 Input Validator Documentation

Class Name: InputValidator

Package: (if applicable, e.g., utils)
Language: Java

Description:

The InputValidator class provides a robust method to validate user input for numeric choices. It ensures that only integer values within a specified range are accepted, helping to prevent invalid input errors during program execution. This is especially useful in menu-driven programs or turn-based games where user choices dictate the flow of the application.

Key Features:

Validates if input is an integer.

Ensures the input falls within a defined minimum and maximum range.

Provides user-friendly prompts when invalid input is detected.

Continuously prompts the user until valid input is entered.


Methods:

public static int getValidChoice(Scanner scanner, int min, int max)

Description: Prompts the user for input and validates that it is an integer within the specified range.

Parameters:

Scanner scanner – The Scanner object used to read user input.

int min – The minimum valid value.

int max – The maximum valid value.


Returns:

int – A validated integer input from the user.


Algorithm / Process:

1. Continuously prompt the user until a valid input is received.


2. Check if the input is an integer using scanner.hasNextInt().


3. If valid, check if the integer is within the given min and max range.


4. If the input is invalid, display a clear error message and prompt again.



Example Usage:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
int choice = InputValidator.getValidChoice(scanner, 1, 5);
System.out.println("You selected option: " + choice);

Benefits:

Reduces runtime errors caused by invalid input.

Improves user experience with clear prompts.

Modular and reusable across multiple programs or modules.
